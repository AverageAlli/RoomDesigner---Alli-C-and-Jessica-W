Jessica Walter|This project aims to create a program that aids the user in redesigning their bedroom space. The   Alli Carr|     GUI generates a floor plan of the bedroom (chosen by the user at startup) and allows the user to                  drag and drop various pieces of furniture and decor pieces into the room to simulate a new and                    refreshed space.
